# DataGuard Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of DataGuard pledge to create a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behavior that contributes to a healthy community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for defining and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor whose behavior is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual represents the project or its community. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Further definitions of representation may be clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [your-email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the reporter of an incident. Further enforcement details may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project leaders.
